### Hi there 👋
I am a professionally trained geologist from a Fortune 500 Energy Exploration Company with a passion for technology, automation, robotics, and coding.  I've used proprietary coding software to automate some of my day-to-day tasks where human-error is common but I would like to learn new software and techniques that can be shared within the tech industry. 

- I’m currently learning about Data Science, Data Analytics, and Full Stack Web Development through Udemy and YouTube courses.
- Some of my current projects include: an automated unemployment payment request project and an online game for 3rd graders to practice their math skills.

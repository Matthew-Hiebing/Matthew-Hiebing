### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt Hiebing.  I am a professionally trained scientist from a Fortune 500 energy exploration company with a passion for technology, automation, robotics, software development, and mechanical keyboards.

During previous jobs, I used proprietary coding software to automate day-to-day tasks where human-error could easily creep into your workflows.  In my last position, I quickly adopted our in-house software and became the go-to-guy for automating laborious project workflows, saving people countless hours throughout their day.  Aside from automation tasks, I also completed projects in data analysis, machine learning, and database management.  Recently, I've made it a goal to learn new non-proprietary software so I can more easily share my projects with others.

I currently work for the Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining as their Information Services Manager.  I am a bit of a jack of all trades.  Some aspects of the job include:
* Building simple to complex queries, stored procedures, views, and query emails for the O&G staff and the public
* Building our new O&G website using PHP, JS (some jQuery), SQL, HTML, and CSS
* Acting as our internal software enhancements project manager and the liaison between O&G staff and our internal/external software development teams

Some of the software/databases/coding languages I work(ed) with include:
* MSSMS, VSCode, RBDMS
* React, Django, SQL, PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, and SASS

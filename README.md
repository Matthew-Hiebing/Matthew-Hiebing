### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt Hiebing.  I am a professionally trained scientist from a Fortune 500 energy exploration company with a passion for building.  Whether it be physical or software-related, I've always had an interest in figuring out how things work and rebuilding/improving them.  I've found that software development keeps my interest and lets me persue my building passion.

I currently work for the Utah's State Board of Education (USBE) as a Software Engineer.  Some aspects of the job include:
* Building simple to complex queries, stored procedures, views, and query emails for teachers, students, administration, and schools across Utah
* Fixing bugs across several pieces of software following the Agile development method
* Rebuilding an API that allows 3rd parties to access parts of USBE's database 

Some of the software/databases/coding languages I work(ed) with include:
* Python, Django, SQL, PHP, JS, jQuery, React, HTML, CSS, JSON, and SASS
* MSSMS, VSCode, RBDMS, and SQLite

I espcially enjoy webdevelopment using all flavors of JS as well as Python in Django.

One of my latest projects is a new website for Utah's DNR Oil and Gas Division (DOGM).  [Here]( https://oilgas.utah.gov/) is a link to the in-production site.  If you're interested in my other work, feel free to browse my other projects here on GitHub or view my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewhiebing/).

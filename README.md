### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt Hiebing.  I am a professionally trained scientist from a Fortune 500 energy exploration company with a passion for technology, automation, software development, robotics, and mechanical keyboards.

I currently work for the Utah's State Board of Education as a Software Engineer.  I am a bit of a jack of all trades but some aspects of the job include:
* Building simple to complex queries, stored procedures, views, and query emails for teachers, students, administration, and schools across Utah

Some of the software/databases/coding languages I work(ed) with include:
* Python, Django, SQL, PHP, JS, jQuery, React, HTML, CSS, JSON, and SASS
* MSSMS, VSCode, RBDMS, and SQLite

One of my latest projects is a new website for Utah's DNR Oil and Gas Division (DOGM).  [Here]( https://oilgas.utah.gov/) is a link to the in-production site.  If you're interested in my other work, feel free to browse my other projects here on GitHub or view my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewhiebing/).

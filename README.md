### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt Hiebing.  I am a professionally trained scientist from a Fortune 500 energy exploration company with a passion for technology, automation, robotics, software development, and mechanical keyboards.

I currently work for the Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining as their Information Services Manager.  I am a bit of a jack of all trades but some aspects of the job include:
* Building simple to complex queries, stored procedures, views, and query emails for the O&G staff and the public
* Building our new O&G website using PHP, JS (some jQuery), SQL, HTML, and CSS
* Acting as our internal software enhancements project manager and the liaison between O&G staff and our internal/external software development teams

Some of the software/databases/coding languages I work(ed) with include:
* MSSMS, VSCode, RBDMS
* Python, Django, SQL, PHP, JS, jQuery, React, HTML, CSS, and SASS

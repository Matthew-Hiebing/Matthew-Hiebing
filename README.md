### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt Hiebing.  I am a professionally trained scientist from a Fortune 500 energy exploration company with a passion for building.  Whether it be physical or software-related, I've always had an interest in figuring out how things work and rebuilding/improving them.  I've found that software development keeps my interest and lets me persue my building passion.
